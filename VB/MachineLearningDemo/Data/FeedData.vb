For the second time Ive come across a fantastic cookbook that was self-published. The first you may remember was the Santa Monica Farmers Market Cookbook by Amelia Saltsman. Its filled with creative recipes that are inspiring and fresh. The second book to impress me is Placer County Real Food recipes and menus for ever week of the year by Joanne Neft with Laura Kenny. This is not a lightweight book written by amateurs. The book begins with Michael Pollans an Eaters Manifesto and an introduction by none other than Deborah Madison The photography is lovely the recipes solid and the layout attractive and easy to use. True to its title the book has a years worth of menus which are naturally in synch with the seasons. While created with the locals of Placer County in mind certainly anyone on the West Coast will find great ideas for meals all year long. There are salads side dishes main dishes and desserts all using farm-fresh ingredients. Neft who opened the first Foothill Farmers Market 20 years ago comes from a midwestern farming family and her food is straight-forward and not fussy. She worked with professional chef Laura Kenny to get the details just right. While there are no vegetarian menus per se there are plenty of dishes that could be the focus of a vegetarian or even vegan meal. I suggest skipping the dates in the book and going by whats in season near you. Its tomato season here in the Bay Area at the moment and the Chilled Tomato Soup made by grating tomatoes with a box grater and adding balsamic vinegar olive oil and basil with a swirl of creme fraiche sounds refreshing and the Watermelon and Heirloom Tomato Salad Greek Style is a nice twist on the original. Often its just subtle seasonings to already delicious ingredients that characterize the recipes. Side dishes like Corn with Cumin or Roasted Baby Carrots with Chard and Cilantro are dead simple to make. Not sure what to do with persimmons pea shoots or pomegranates WIth short ingredient lists and easy techniques this is  a fine choice for meat and potatoes types look to branch out with farmers market produce.More Check out a selection of recipes on the cookbook website.DO NOT STEAL 2010 Cooking with Amy.

                    .Content="Summer Eats in San Francisco If youve never been to San Francisco you need to know our Summer starts NOW. Yes in September. Not only is it pretty and warm and sunny but Summer produce--tomatoes corn pepper and peaches are all ripe and delicious at the moment. Its easy to roll your eyes at our sustainable local organic mantra but while youre here be sure to try some of these bites of Summer. Around this time of year just about everyone makes a tomato salad but one that sticks out in my mind as particularly fabulous is the Heirloom Tomato Salad with mozzarella di bufala olio verde basil and olive oil croutons at Scalas Bistro which is attached to the Sir Francis Drake Hotel at Union Square. Its the variety of tomatoes which are the star of the show but they share the stage with the milkiest creamy and moist mozzarella. An interesting addition too is the olive oil croutons which obviously add crunch and body to the salad. Hapa Ramen  isnt exactly like any ramen I have had before. The Slow Cooked Ramen with seasonal vegetables is the one to seek out. The broth is layered with richness and the bits of pork make it a meal. The broth is a little bit sweet and a little bit salty. But its the fresh and super sweet crunch of corn that really makes this ramen something special. You can find it at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market on Thursdays or at Off the Grid on Fridays. I dont know exactly when shishito peppers started showing up at farmers markets but I think I first saw them about 2 or 3 years ago. I had tried them in Japan and was thrilled to see them not just in markets but on restaurant menus as well. They are typically quickly fried then sprinkled with salt. But at Hog  Rocks in the Mission District they go one step further and add a squeeze of lime. The result is bright and lively the perfect bar snack. Mostly these peppers are mild and sweet with an earthy green flavor but every once in a while you will get a spicy one My last Summer pick is the sorbet from Scream Sorbet. These surprisingly creamy dairy-free sorbets made from Summer fruit are an intense blast of flavor. Despite not having a retail location yet they made 7x7s recent The Big Sweet SF 50 Treats to eat before you die. Fortunately you can find the sorbet at many farmers markets around the Bay Area including the San Francisco Ferry Plaza on Thursdays. Try the seasonal fruit flavors like Flavorosa pluot peach raspberry and August Fire nectarine.  They are not sickly sweet but tangy and juicy in a way that screams Summer.

                    .Content="The Keys To Good Cooking by Harold McGee You may be familiar with Harold McGee from the monthly The Curious Cook column he writes for the New York Times that looks at the science behind cooking. He has explained  why adding water adds flavor to coffee and cocktails why cilantro tastes like soap for some  and how to prolong the life of berries.Harold McGees book On Food and Cooking is a classic reference and quite wonderful but frankly a bit geeky. Ive been fortunate to hear McGee speak a few times and Ive always learned a lot. Last time he mentioned his upcoming book The Keys to Good Cooking and told the audience that it would help answer the questions home cooks have about the practical side of kitchen science.Ill be reviewing the book when it comes out in October but in the meantime I got a peek at a few pages and gleaned these wonderful tips to help you succeed with braisingBeware of recipes that call for an oven temperature over 180F80C. Never let a braise or stew get hot enough to bubble when the meat is cooking. A closed pot in an oven at any temperature above the boiling point will come to the boil. At oven temperatures above 180F80C leave the pot open to allow evaporative cooling and produce a lower cooking temperature.To braise or stew tough cuts of meat in a few hours heat them at 180F80C. They will develop the dry tenderness of standard braises and stews.To braise or stew tender cuts quickly or tough cuts over a day or more to keep them especially moist heat them at 140-150F60-65C.Here are links to my past posts on Harold McGeeGastronomic turns 10 with Harold McGeeHarold McGee  Shirley CorriherDO NOT STEAL 2010 Cooking with Amy.

                    .Content="Grana Padano For as long as I can remember Ive heard that Parmigiano Reggiano was the king of cheeses. Its the cheese I ate in Italy and cooked with as well. Its the cheese I always buy. I knew about Grana Padano but believed it was inferior to Parmigiano. A substitute. Poor mans Parmigiano. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.First of all technically you could say Parmigiano is a type of Grana. Grana means grain and refers to the grainy texture of the cheese and Padano refers to the region where it is produced. Parmigiano is produced in Parma Reggio Emilia and Modena. Grana is produced in Piedmont Lombardy Piacenza Veneto and Trentino. Both cheeses are lactose free and a good source of protein and calcium.Grana Produced in a large region Less expensive than Parmigiano Made from raw skim milk  Cows fed grass cereal amp silage Cows can be treated with antibiotics Aged from 9 to 24 months and up Natural preservative lysozyme Parmigiano Produced in a small region More expensive than Grana Made from raw skim milk  whole milk Cows fed grass amp cereal Cows not treated with antibiotics Aged 24 months or more Free of preservativesBecause Grana uses more skim milk it is lower in fat and develops flavor more quickly than Parmigiano. I tasted and compared Grana Padano that was aged only 16-20 months and Parmigiano Reggiano that was aged 28-32 months. Here are my tasting notesGranaButtery rich sweet and mildly salty nutty creamy with a floral and fruity scent and a flaky crunchy crystalline textureParmigianoVery salty rich nutty earthy some crystalline crunchinessThe shocking verdict I actually preferred the Grana Because cheese is a natural and seasonal product there will be differences throughout the year. But I encourage you to do your own taste test. I no longer believe Grana is a more popular cheese in Italy only out of price considerations. I will still buy Parmigiano on occasion but for day to day use Ill be switching to Grana. Both cheeses can be used as a table cheese grated over pasta salad in traditional risotto dishes and with roasted vegetables.Recipes using GranaRecipes using ParmigianoNotes I bought the Parmigiano from Rainbow Grocery the Grana was provided for me and came from Di Palo Selects.

                    .Content="Americano Restaurant Review Ive eaten at Americano three times in the past couple of months and each time it was better than the last. Located on the ground floor of the Hotel Vitale its main architectural feature is a large patio that runs the length of the restaurant and faces the bay. With heat lamps plenty of tables chairs and even couches its one of my favorite outdoor dining spaces in San Francisco (Foreign Cinema is the other). The menu has something for everybody with plenty of appetizers for sharing or light meals pasta Italian entrees and even a hamburger. While Ive enjoyed the fish and hearty steak entrees its been the pizza pasta and appetizers that have made me a fan.Their take on the Margherita pizza the pizza fresca 15 is puffy and crisp and not overburdened with toppings. It has that melting quality I love when sauce cheese and crust all meld together.  My favorite dishes are the appetizers 7 each or 3 for 18. The luscious tonno conserva is so rich and delicate it will wipe away any memory of domestic canned tuna.  Also notable are the arancini and the artichoke and brussels sprouts fritti. None of the fried bites are greasy or heavy. Its hard for me not to order pasta especially when it is homemade. Chef Kory Stewart makes fantastic stuffed pasta supple and soft simple yet with very high quality ingredients. You can get his pasta in smaller or larger portions. If you want to try several dishes I wont blame you for ordering the small portion but if youre like me you will be sad when its gone. His pastas are often dressed simply with just a bit of olive oil or butter and topped with a bit of herbs or vegetables. The version with fava beans and Meyer lemon was a wonderful expression of late spring. While Ive enjoyed several desserts the one not to miss is the Mocha Custard 5. Served in an espresso cup it is is rich and creamy and the happiest marriage of chocolate and coffee.Americano Restaurant  Bar8 Mission Street  EmbaracaderoSan Francisco CA 94105(415) 278-3777DO NOT STEAL 2010 Cooking with Amy.

                    .Content="Zucchini Salad with Feta Recipe Everyone I know is looking for a good recipe that uses zucchini. Enormous zucchini appear from behind large green leaves surprising even the most vigilant gardeners. It seems there is always too much of it. No one complains about too many peaches or too many tomatoes. Too much zucchini Its likely to be left on a neighbors doorstep as a present. This salad is one of my favorite ways to cook and eat zucchini. Its based on a salad in Claudia Rodens The Book of Middle Eastern Food a book I turn to again and again. I like it seasoned with toasted cumin instead of coriander and caraway and a little bit of scallion to add texture and oniony flavor. Its called a salad but its soft like a dip. The sweetness of the zucchini is balanced by the saltiness of the feta the sourness of the lemon. If you want to make even the blandest vegetable taste good I recommend dousing it in olive oil lemon juice garlic and topping it with fetaFor a light Summer meal Id serve this salad well chilled along with bread and other assorted vegetable side dishes like this Middle Eastern carrot salad tomato salad marinated mushrooms or with hummus and pita or grilled kebabs. Its a healthy dish to keep in the fridge for a little snack though you may find you polish if off pretty quickly.Zucchini Salad with FetaServes 2-41 lb zucchiniJuice of 12 lemon3 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil12 teaspoon chili paste or harissa1 clove garlic pressed or finely minced and mashed12 teaspoon toasted ground cumin2 scallions white and pale green parts only minced14 cup feta crumbledSaltCut zucchini into about 5 pieces and place in a large saucepan cover with water add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil.

                    .Content="Off the Grid Last Friday night I was glad to join the street food revolution at Off the Grid. Off the Grid takes place Friday nights from 5 pm until 9 pm in the Fort Mason Center parking lot right near the entrance by the little guardhouse. Its a great mix of carts people food and drink. Families couples and groups can be found mingling eating chatting and discovering deliciously affordable bites of food. There was plenty of room to walk around chairs and a few tables and there was even some live music. There was no overcrowding significant waits or lines (Chairman Bao had a line but it moved quickly). The most difficult decision may be what to try because with about 10 vendors there is no way to try it all. They ranged from traditional taco trucks like El Tonayense to the new fangled Creme Brulee cart.I started with potato beef curry puffs from Malaysian Lacy Crepes. They were freshly fried to a crisp on the outside with a tender and mid curry on the inside. Like most things the portion was good for sharing. I want to try their chai banana fritters next. I was very impressed with Chairman Bao. I tried both a duck confit and mango bun and the pork belly bun steamed 2.75 each. Both were juicy and fresh but I think the crunchy daikon pickle in the pork version made it my favorite. They also have a baked version. Next timeLee had a cup of chai which came in various flavors such as rose and vanilla almond. It seemed a bit pricey to me at 4 a cup. Most of the dishes were in the 2 to 6 range. He also approved of the lemon mochi and succulent adobo chicken. The spiciest bites came from Curry Up Now. The Indian street food truck. The Kathi roll made from roti stuffed with pickled onion chutney and chicken was hot stuff In the future Id love to see Chinese dumplings or some kind of noodle dish along the lines of the Noodle Fest in Chinatown.

                    .Content="9 Stir Fry Secrets from Grace Young Are you a stir fraud Do you stir fry or do you stir faux During a recent taping of Youre Doing It All Wrong for Chow I learned I was making some pretty big mistakes when it comes to stir frying hence my less than stellar results. The video is not quite ready yet but to tide you over heres what I learned from stir fry master and cookbook author Grace Young. Her latest book Stir Frying to the Skys Edge is out now.  Use a 14-inch wok. Other sizes are too small to cook enough food or too large to heat properly on a typical home range. Find a carbon steel flat bottom wok. RESIST the urge to use a non-stick wok It cannot be heated high enough to give you good results. If you must use a 12-inch skillet. But again not non-stick When you marinate meat for stir frying which only takes five minutes add a little bit of oil. Use a high smoke point oil such as peanut canola grapeseed. Grace said rice bran oil is good too and thats generally what I have on hand.  Hot pan cold oil Do not add the oil to your wok until it is hot hot hot Otherwise the food will stick stick stick. Use the highest heat possible To get good caramelization spread out the meat and really let it sear before stirring. Stir fry the meat only until its 34 of the way done before removing it and adding the vegetables. Be sure vegetables are good and dry when they go in the wok. Dont crowd the pan The amount of vegetables will vary depending on the type but a rule of thumb is no more than 34 of a pound meat and maximum 4 cups vegetables. But you want to know the most important thing I learned You can make a better stir fry at home than you can get in a restaurant. Really. According to Grace you are much more likely to use higher quality ingredients than your local Chinese restaurant. And if you do it right your results should be better.

                    .Content="Archway Cookies A Nostalgic Review When I was growing up we didnt have soda or candy in the house or junk food like Twinkies but we did have cookies. Sometimes my mom made cookies from scratch and sometimes she bought them. The thing is some cookies need to be fresh and homemade like chocolate chip cookies or oatmeal cookies. They just dont taste right to me if they arent. But then there are some commercially produced cookies that are just fine and dandy. When I was growing up I can almost guarantee you would have found pecan sandies lemon coolers raisin biscuits or almond windmills in the cookie jar. Oddly enough most of those cookies are not so easy to find these days. Pecan sandies are a kind of shortbread cookie flecked with bits of nuts and are the only cookie I still routinely see in the supermarket (though reviews seem to say they arent as good as they used to be).  Lemon coolers were very tangy cookies coated in powdered sugar. Raisin biscuits were affectionately known as fly biscuits in my family. They were thin layers of cookie filled with raisins. They came in long strips that were perforated. Almond windmills later became just windmills as the amount of slivered almonds was drastically reduced. Windmills are based on a spiced Dutch cookie called speculaas. Recently I got an email informing me that Archway was launching an iced lemonade cookie. Was I interested in trying some samples Little did I know I would receive 13 packages of cookies in the mail. 13. Packages. Of cookies. So for you my dear readers I opened virtually every package and tried them. Call it professional responsibility. Somebody has got to try all those cookies and it might as well be me Not every cookie made the cut but a few varieties rose above the rest. Here are the ones I think are particularly noteworthyMolasses CookiesThese are soft big cookies with a lingering molasses flavor and a bit of crunch from the decorative sugar crystals. Perfect with a mug of black tea and milk. Ginger SnapsI like these a lot. They really have a good bite of ginger in them and are not too sweet. They would also be great in desserts. Id use ginger snap crumbs in place of graham crackers to make a press in type of crust or to top an apple or pear crisp. Iced MolassesYou have to like molasses to appreciate these chewy little gems but I enjoyed them even more than the larger soft molasses version.They are really good and strong like a bracing cup of black coffee. Iced LemonadeThese are not my beloved lemon coolers but I like them. They are tangy not too sweet even though they are frosted. Actually I  think most of the lemon flavor comes from the glaze. They are small and very crunchy. WindmillsThese are practically as I remember them just light on almonds. From the photo its impossible to see any almond flakes but they are in there. The primary flavor is cinnamon but there are other sweet spices too. Windmills are hard cookies but not as hard as the ginger snaps. They have an almost melting sandy texture. Are they that delicious or am I just being nostalgic Hard to say. But I am enjoying them immensely.You will find these cookies in various supermarkets.

                    .Content="Asparagus Hot Brown Recipe When I was in Louisville Kentucky a couple of weeks ago I tried the famous Hot Brown sandwich at the Brown Hotel. Its a rich combination of dreamy Mornay sauce hearty turkey a couple of tomato wedges and crisp bacon on top. Broiling the sandwich makes the tomatoes and sauce even tastier. But its a monster I really dont know how anyone can finish it. If you go to Louisville by all means do try it. If you dont have an enormous appetite you can order a smaller portion of the Hot Brown. Its not on the menu but it is available upon request.All over Kentucky you will find different versions of the Hot Brown. Some have ham instead of turkey or a combination of both or seafood and no turkey or ham. When I got home I decided I would try my hand at making a slightly lighter version of this delectable sandwich. But I figured why not try it with asparagus After all asparagus and cheese sauce is already pretty tasty. While I love Mornay sauce I rarely have heavy cream on hand so I made a simpler cheese sauce. I kept the bacon because I think the salty smoky flavor and crunch really are important in this mostly soft fork-and-knife style sandwich. I also like the juicy tomatoes so I kept them in the mix.The Hot Brown was created as a late night snack for dancing partying Louisvillians who craved something other than a midnight breakfast. But actually I think it makes a great breakfast or lunch. I know my other half would it eat it for breakfast if I put a fried egg on it Then again he would eat just about anything with a fried egg on it.

                    .Content="Mi Pueblo Supermarket Have I mentioned how much I truly enjoy grocery shopping I might not even buy anything but no matter where I go home or away I am fascinated to see what is on offer. As my friend Joe Kowalke says Grocery shopping is my baseball. And I am an equal opportunity shopper. I like everything from fancy shops like Dean  Deluca that carry artisanal products to Asian Middle Eastern and Russian grocery stores and even supermarkets. I like discovering spices produce cheeses sausages prepared foods baked goods even packaged food Ive never seen before and noticing what people are buying. My latest shopping discovery comes courtesy of my dad who shares my love of grocery shopping. Its Mi Pueblo a supermarket that serves the local community in the Canal District of San Rafael. Its the first Latino supermarket Ive ever visited and I loved it There were so many interesting things to see like yards of chorizo aisles of packaged flan exotic spiky vegetables and piles of piioncillo sugar. Theres even a taqueria and a panaderia right inside the store. The prices for fresh produce were very reasonable and they carry many unusual things like fresh garbanzo beans and all types of crema that I cant easily find elsewhere so I know I will be back again. The chickens roasting over mesquite smelled amazing and the guy out front selling oysters in shell was doing a bustling business. I probably wont be buying margaritas in a can or Peruvian soy sauce but I now know where to find both under one roofGet the flash player here httpwww.adobe.comflashplayerSee the slide show of my visit to Mi Pueblo.More posts and stories on Mi PuebloJulies UpdateSilicon Valley MomsMarin Retail BuzzMarin Independent JournalDO NOT STEAL 2010 Cooking with Amy.

                    .Content="Food and Wine Wine goes with food. I know this sounds obvious but not that long ago I got into a disagreement with a wine blogger about this very subject. Her point was that not all wine needs to be paired with food some people enjoy wine without food. Well not me. If I want something to sip after dinner on its own I might choose a luxurious and sweet dessert wine such as Sauternes Tokaji Port or Madeira. As an aperitif I prefer something crisp and sparkling Champagne perhaps. Or a cocktail. There is a segment of the wine drinking public that has taken to drinking wine as if it were a cocktail. They want their wine big bold with little acid plenty of tannin and dont seem to mind if its tremendously alcoholic (I mean over 14.5 alcohol). Again not me. In Old World wine-producing countries there is a culture of drinking wine with meals. But in the New World that isnt always the way everyone is introduced to the pleasures of wine. So some people end up favoring wines that compete with sherry in terms of alcohol. Dont even get me started on the astronomical prices of some of these wines. By the bottle or the glass I want wine I can actually afford to buy.I remember once being told that in ballet the ballerina is the picture and her partner is the frame. Id say the same thing is true about food and wine. Food is the picture wine is the frame. A good frame can compliment a picture but on its own its just a frame. I used to attend a lot of wine tastings but I found I was comparing one wine to another and the wines I liked the best in tastings rarely impressed me as much when I tried them with food. So I stopped going to so many wine tastings. You might say Im not sophisticated enough to appreciate wines on their own but in my opinion no wine can ever compete with the perfect pairing of food and wine. While I dont entirely agree with experts and bloggers like Alder of Vinography who say that food and wine pairing is a scam I do agree that there are no right answers and that ultimately you should drink what you like with whatever food you choose. I also believe there are pairings that are pure magic. Notice I said pairings there is never just one good pair. The excellent guide book What to Drink with What You Eat shows many great pairs and is a constant source of inspiration for me because finding those matches is something I strive for each and every time I open a bottle. For me the highest compliment I can pay a wine is that I find it food friendly. But really that is what every wine should be.DO NOT STEAL 2010 Cooking with Amy. All rights reserved.

                    .Content="Slow Roasted Salmon Recipe Go get yourself some Copper River King salmon. RIGHT NOW. I am not kidding. I dont believe there is a more delicious salmon than Copper River King also known as Chinook and the time to enjoy it is right now. The season begins in the middle of May when the fish are gorgeous orange rich with healthy fats including the highest level of prized omega 3 fatty acids. It has a delicate flavor and velvet texture that cannot be beat. The quality of the fish declines as the season progresses so get some at the peak of deliciousness. Like right now. When cooking Copper River King you really want the fish to be the star. It doesnt need much fussing over. I prepared some this past week in various ways and here is what I would suggest cook it either very quickly under the broiler or very slowly in a low oven. The slow cooking method yields a very creamy almost custardy texture that is super moist and succulent. I first learned about this style of cooking from a Jacques Pepin recipe but many other takes on this recipe exist. I like crispy salmon skin so I sear the fish first then gently cook it in the oven set at only 200 degrees. Its important to check it often to make sure it doesnt overcook. A light dusting of smoky spices and a little salt and brown sugar lends a lovely color but doesnt obliterate the natural clean flavor of the fish. When making the spice rub use the freshest ground spices if they are over six months old toss em outCopper River King salmon from Alaska is expensive but a little goes a long way just 4 ounces makes a satisfying serving. Its like the seafood equivalent of chocolate--luscious creamy and melts in your mouth. Id rather have a little high quality chocolate than all I can eat of the cheap stuff. Wild-caught  Copper River King from Alaska is high in protein and low in saturated fat and is certified as sustainable to the standard of the Marine Stewardship Council. Alaskan salmon are among the most intensively managed species considered a best choice by the Monterey Bay Aquariums Seafood Watch. Delicious healthy and sustainable It doesnt get much better than that.Slow Roasted Salmon 1 lb Copper River King salmon1 12 teaspoons smoked paprika1 12 teaspoons garam masala1 12 teaspoons toasted and ground cumin 12 teaspoon kosher salt12 teaspoon brown sugar1 mango pitted peeled and diced a firm variety such as Tommy AtkinsIn a small bowl combine the smoked paprika garam masala cumin salt and sugar. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Coat the top of the salmon with a heaping teaspoon of spice rub. Rub it into the surface of the fish and shake off any extra. Cut into 4 portions.Heat a cast iron pan over medium heat. When the pan is very hot sear the salmon skin side down for 2 minutes. Transfer to oven and bake until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 125 degrees the temperature will continue to rise after you remove the fish from the oven. The total cooking time will depend on how thick the fish is the rule of thumb is 10 minutes per inch. Top with a spoonful of mango and serve immediately.

                    .Content="Great Summer Cookbooks Winter is the easiest time of year to feel motivated to cook. When its cold outside nothing is better than hunkering down in a cozy kitchen to braise and bake and simmer the day away.  Summer time is perhaps the toughest season for cooking. Who wants to be in the kitchen when the weather is beckoning you to stay in the sun  When I think of Summer I think of tomato salads guacamole ceviche and big antipasto platters served al fresco. And of course anything and everything on the grill. There are tons of grilling cookbooks and each season a new batch comes out (in fact you can find a recent round up of grilling book reviews on MattBites). But this year there are two Summer cookbooks that go way beyond just grilling giving you many more options when things heat up. They are very different books though either would be perfect to take with you on Summer vacation to a beach house or mountain cabin or make a great hostess gift. The Big Summer Cookbook is a soft cover book with 300 recipes written by author Jeff Cox who seems particularly attuned to what is ripe and in season. The book starts with a Summer seasonality chart and perhaps even more interestingly a section on how to stock your Summer pantry. This would be helpful in planning meals for a week at a Summer house. There are recipes for no-cook dishes such as Mango Watermelon Salad and Caprese Skewers as well as some baked goods that you will want to eat during the Summer such as Plum and Nectarine Crisp and Sour Cream Breakfast Cake. Recipes I have bookmarked include a No-Cook Blackberry Pie that features a graham cracker crust and a Couscous Salad with Pine Nuts and Summer Fruit. The vegetable and fruit recipes are more interesting in general than the meat recipes which tend to be standbys such as  burgers and grilled chicken.  There are some new ideas in this book but its really more about the basics. Read an excerpt.By contrast the substantial hardcover Recipes from an Italian Summer will make you dream of Summer in a villa eating dishes like Grilled Sardines scented with Orange Wild Duck with Figs and Spaghetti and Lobster. It begins with a seasonal food calendar and features nearly 400 exciting and adventurous recipes. These are primarily Italian recipes many you have not likely seen before. With a few notable exceptions they are generally not complicated dishes and in tune with the season but written for someone who is a confident cook. By in tune I mean things you might want to eat in Summer as there are recipes using ingredients not strictly available in the Summer like apples and radicchio. Here and there the recipes suffer from less than optimal translations. But they are the things you will want to eat when you get bored of tomato salad and grilled chicken. The book has gorgeous photos of food in a rustic style and lots of photos of Italy. If you love Italian food you will find this book deeply satisfying because of the many fresh ideas it presents although there is some overlap with the Silver Spoon cookbook. Personally I cant wait to make dishes like Potato Pizza and Sunflower Petal Salad. Its a book that inspires. Look inside the book.DO NOT STEAL 2010 Cooking with Amy. All rights reserved.

                    .Content="Top 20 Cooking Myths There are lots of myths in regards to cooking. Sadly they tend to discourage people from practicing a very basic life skill. Here are the myths about cooking that I have heard repeatedly from friends acquaintances and even cooking pundits. Are any of them keeping YOU out of the kitchen1. You cant cook anything good in a short amount of timeYou dont need to cook something complicated or cutting edge (unless of course you want to) plenty of great recipes take very little time at all. Here are just a few examples Asparagus Frittata from Simply RecipesBlack Bean Clams from Single Guy ChefHigh-roast Chicken and Potatoes from HedoniaGrilled Tri Tip Steak with Chimol Salsa from Kalyns KitchenOrechiette with Sausage and Kale from The KitchnWhole Wheat Spaghetti with Aglio e Olio from Skillet ChroniclesChoose from steak chicken pasta seafood some dishes are even vegetarian--all are delicious2. Cooking takes too longI dont know what too long means. But I can cook dinner faster than you can get it served to you at a restaurant and quicker than it takes to get it delivered. Really. Dont believe me Revisit the recipes above. 3. You need lots of ingredients There are tons of recipes that use 5 ingredients or less. Just check out this collection on Epicurious. Or just revisit the recipes above the ingredients for those recipe would fit in a single grocery bag. 4. Cooking is not enjoyableCooking can and SHOULD BE ENJOYABLE Its not just a necessity its actually fun or why would so many bloggers (myself included)  be droning on about it endlessly5. Cooking is hardCooking in a restaurant is hard work. Cooking at home does not need to be hard. If you dont believe me see Michael Ruhlmans sarcastically named Worlds Most Difficult Roasted Chicken Recipe. 6. You need to use processed foods to save time effort and moneyProcessed foods actually cost more than raw foods not less. They do not necessarily save you time. The Kitchn did a test to see what the difference was between making a cake from scratch and from a mix. The results will surprise you7. Cooking from scratch is expensive even more than eating outCheck out this bloggers challenge to create 2 a serving meals. 8. Cooking requires a lot of skillNope. Even dummies can cook French food. 9. You need expensive pots and pan to cookThe Breakaway Cook shows you how to use some of the cheapest pans around cast iron. 10. You need lots of expensive knives to cookThree knives. Thats all you need And this from a restaurant blogger. 11. You need a very well-stocked kitchen to cookA basic pantry doesnt need to be overflowing with ingredients. Not sure where to start Check out this primer on Slashfood. 12. Good cooks never use recipesThere are cooks who advocate ratios rather than recipes but you know what They too use recipes too sometimes. 13. Good cooks always use recipesPastry chef and blogger Shuna Lydon dispels this myth thoughtfully and provocatively. 14. Cooking is too messyYes cooking can be messy. But you should be able to clean everything in your kitchen. Keeping your kitchen clean is not a good reason for not cooking15. Cleaning up takes longer than cooking so its not worth the effortThe secret is to clean as you cook just ask Martha. 16. Cooking is too dangerous for kids to doWhen kids learn to cook with adult supervision its not dangerous. Check out Whats Cooking Blog to learn more about cooking with kids. 17. Cooking is fattening and leads to overeating By cooking you can control and be aware of exactly what is in your food. I guess if you cook well you might be inclined to overeat but thats about will power not cooking18. You must follow recipes exactly or they wont workIf that was true you would never see the word adapted next to recipes. 19.    Cooking is menial or dullIn the 1950s women were told that cooking was a chore and not worth the effort. Laura Shapiro writes about the phenomenon in Something from the Oven. But cooking was and is something truly enjoyable. Cleaning might be menial and dull but cooking is a joy. The classic cookbook that proclaims it so has sold over 18 million copies 20.

                    .Content="Anthony Boutard on What Makes Fruit Great One of the best presentations I got to attend at the International Association of Culinary Professionals conference in Portland last month was a conversation between chef and cookbook author Deborah Madison and farmer Anthony Boutard of Ayers Creek Farm. Ayers Creek Farm is an organic farm located in Gaston Oregon in the Wapato Valley 10 miles west of Beaverton and 40 miles from the ocean. The theme was fruit and I learned so much Here are a just a few highlights from the discussionDeborah Madison asked What makes fruit great  Boutard said in some ways its hard to say because everyones palate is different for example some people love tart marionberries some people hate them.   According to Boutard the best fruit has acidity upfront. Acid and tannins in fruit are complex and cannot be simply duplicated by adding   lemon juice. Sweetness on the other hand is not very complex.   Shipped fruit seems like it loses acidity (another reason to buy local).  The best way to get shoppers to warm up to fruit with high acid is to give samples to their kids. Kids love acidity  Some fruit are best suited to wide temperature variation such as melons and plums that want hot days and cool nights. Different plums grow in different parts of the country. In California there are lots of Japanese plums and in Oregon more European plums.   Cellared fruit takes on different characteristics. It wont have the same texture it may not be crisp but the flavor can be amazing. Boutard said the best apple he ever ate was a russet apple in Switzerland it had been cellared for many months and was mealy but complex and delicious.   Grapes with seeds have more flavor and nutritional value. Boutard calls grapes celibate or fecund instead of seedless or seeded. A little sex helps sell  Grapes with seeds dont last as long as seedless varieties but the seeds are worth eating too. You cant eat Concord grape seeds but other grape seeds have a spicy flavor that balances the sweetness of the fruit.   Picking fruit takes real skill. For example some fruit needs to be watered the night before picking such as raspberries other fruit like plums will split if watered when already ripe. Boutard has been working with the same Oaxacan family for years because they understand how to pick fruit.   Systemic pesticides and fungicides cannot be washed off fruit. Boutard chooses to grow fruit that is well-suited to the environment and can be grown organically rather than fight mother nature.  Machine picked fruit is not as fully ripe because it is picked using beaters.   The best way to judge the quality of most fruit is to smell it. Dont look at the size. The first batch of fruit often has more pectin in it that the subsequent crops.DO NOT STEAL 2010 Cooking with Amy. All rights reserved.

                    .Content="Numi Puerh Tea I have become a puerh pusher. Anyone who takes so much as a whiff from my cup ends up buying their own. I discovered puerh tea a few years ago at a wonderful tea shop Modern Tea run by tea expert Alice Cravens (now sadly closed). It was served in the traditional manner in a tiny tea pot with tea broken from a cake of puerh. Not long after I purchases some loose puerh tea from Tillerman Tea in Napa. But its the perfect-for-sampling Numi Tea tea bags that have made me go pro.Puerh is a fermented and aged green tea that has many of the characteristics of black tea and more antioxidants than either black or green tea. It is dark and malty with rich flavor that can handle a splash of milk. Up until recently it was almost impossible to find high quality puerh tea bags. Normally I buy all my tea loose leaf bulk never in bags but Numi Tea is making some fabulous puerh tea blends available in bags. They use whole leaf tea not dust. The convenience of tea bags has worked well for me because I am usually just drinking one cup and I often take a few bags in my purse and my suitcase. Back in January I participated in Numis Puerh Challenge. I didnt drink three cups a day because its just too much caffeine for me. But I quickly added to my stash buying boxes of Magnolia Puerh and Emperors Puerh to my favorite the Chocolate version. The Numi Chocolate Puerh tea is a blend of all organic ingredients--puerh tea cocoa powder vanilla Theo chocolate cocoa nibs rooibos orange peel nutmeg and cinnamon. It is such a treat It has lovely spicy notes that pair with the mild chocolate and rich tea.For a more delicate tea I like the floral Magnolia blend which has green tea and magnolia flowers along with the puerh. The Emperors version is pure puerh nothing else added. It is the most robust with toasty rich flavor great when you feel like you want a cup of coffee. The only version Im not crazy about is the Mint Puerh but to each his own. Numi also sells puerh in a brick and in bulk which is probably what I will end up purchasing next. The advantage to the brick is that a small amount of tea can be used again and again to make up to 4 cups of tea. Puerh is considered a very healthy tea potentially strengthening your immune system and reducing the risk of heart attack. Other studies show tea can reduce cholesterol and triglycerides and lower blood pressure. I would love to tell you I lost weight drinking this tea but I dont think I did. But it absolutely gets me going in the morning on those days when I need a little extra boost and the different varieties seem to fit my mood at different times of the day.

                    .Content="Mango Cucumber Salad Recipes Ok heres a crazy idea one basic salad that can be either sweet or savory. I was trying to think of what to do with some mangoes coming my way from the National Mango Board this week and then I saw a tweet from SimpleGourmetLA with the idea for a mojito cucumber mango and strawberry salad. It occurred to me that both cucumber and mango could go either way--sweet or savory. Im always looking for ways to use common ingredients in slightly unexpected ways. Here the twist is using cucumber in a sweet fruit salad and using sweet mango in a savory salad. English cucumber is available year round and does not need to be peeled. It has a very mild flavor and a fine texture without big slippery seeds. Best of all it has a terrific crunch I used the most commonly available mango the Tommy Atkins variety in both salads. Its not a very tropical luscious or creamy mango but more of a workhorse with citrus-like flavor able and willing to stand up to whatever you demand of it. Its a bit on the firm side so its particularly good in salads.  For the sweet salad I combined cucumber mango and strawberries and for the savory version cucumber mango and radishes. You might recognize the ingredients from the savory salad as being similar to what you find Mexican street vendors selling. Each salad is flavored with lime but the sweet salad gets a touch of honey and mint the savory salad a pinch of salt and green onion. Both are bursting with juiciness crunch and Summery flavors and would be great at a picnic. Id serve the savory salad with grilled fish or chicken. Id serve the sweet salad with a scoop of sorbet or just a couple of cookies.Mango Cucumber Strawberry SaladServes 41 Tommy Atkins mango peeled pitted and cut into chunks12 large English cucumber cut into chunks1 pint strawberries trimmed and cut in chunksJuice of a fresh lime squeezed2 teaspoons honey2 sprigs chopped fresh mint leaves about 12 levesIn a mixing bowl combine the lime and honey and stir until smooth.

                    .Content="Interview with Claudia Roden - part 2 Photo credit Red Saunders In part 1 of my interview with Claudia Roden she shared her experiences from years of writing about the food of the Middle East and her thoughts about cooking in the US and Britain. In part two she tells us about her upcoming Spanish cookbook recipe testing and her opinions on culinary innovation. For years Ive read that youre working on a Spanish cookbook how is that coming alongFor 5 years I worked on it and Ive just given it in. I spent years eating meeting people having fun also doing a lot of research and the history of Spain through its food the literature and so on. I researched the life of the aristocracy the peasants the church every recipe has meaning. I only include a recipe if it tastes good usually if it lasts 100 years it is good. The added pleasure is to know how it fits in to the culture. It becomes a way of life and its been very enriching. In a year it will be out we are now doing the food photography when I get back (to London) we will start again. The photographer is going around in Spain. Ive done two editions of the book one in metric and one in cups for the American edition so its taken rather longer. I always want to test everything myself. I want to make sure of the measures. I am the responsible one so I want to do it. Your recipes are some of the most reliable and consistent I have ever used. Whats your opinion of recipe testersYou have to give other indications by that I mean not just timing cups and measures. Until now I had never used recipe testers but I also invite people to dinner or invite one person to dinner and feed them so that is my test. Right now after having tested all the recipes 2-3 times they are being tested again. My published in the UK Penguin has a policy to retest all recipes so they asked if I wouldnt mind. I was very glad but Im crossing out a lot that has been put in by the tester. I do add variations in time but she has put in so much material that I fear will put off anyone from cooking I want recipes to be short and direct. I assume someone knows a bit how to cook. She puts in every dish how to fry onions I just think if people are busy with the timing they may not pay attention to the other signs. You cant tell everyone everything the best is to teach them to gauge for themselves. Theyll have to learn to be confident of their taste and their senses. You cant put every single eventuality in a recipe. I believe you must trust people to use their common sense. People should really trust their senses. You must trust your taste. Cooking is an art of the senses. We can explain as writers thats our job not to just give measures. You and Paula Wolfert are both heroines of mine. You both seem to be able to get amazing details from home cooks. What are the keys to getting people to share their recipes especially people notorious for not sharing recipes like Italians I do a lot of advanced contact. In Italy the very first contact was an ideal one. I was invited to a dinner with regional chefs and cookery teachers from around the country and there was a man who organized things that had connections to other culinary enthusiasts around the country. Cooking teachers were very generous. They were not necessarily teaching Italian food but I got them to help me make contacts. I found food lovers who go out to eat  in different towns I had personal connections that helped. I didnt waste any time at all since I was under pressure from the Times. I would ask people on the train for help I would ask someone in a train compartment what is your favorite food and several people would join in the conversation. I was told (by the newspaper) to go everywhere eat everything take people with me but I couldnt always fit in so many meals so I just phoned numbers from the phone book calling randomly and asked people what do they eat But none of the recipes from restaurants or from home cooks worked. You have to try and use your common sense. You cant force people to be absolutely correct. In Spain I observed people cooking at cooking schools. In cooking and catering schools they teach Spanish and International food but all that the young people want is to use machines and technology. They are all besotted by Ferran. On the other hand there is almost a backlash in Spain where people are concerned with preserving their culture and region. The threat has galvanized them to not give up on their beloved recipes. Speaking of Spain where do you stand on culinary innovationI am very impressed by a lot of innovators I am not only tolerant but I think everyone is free to invent. Of course a lot of chefs think they have to invent everyday to be respected. In the past people had pride in their dishes even classics. Now people feel driven to do something new. In a way a lot of messing about happens artificially. When there was change it was due to society--like hybrid dishes of different cultures that took 100 years to become part of the culture. There is change in food when culture changes but to have a culture where you despise tradition and only revere innovation is very sad. Food is part of identity. Countries like France and Italy should not give up there identity besides most people are not very good at innovation. I dont see the point in innovating to surprise or to gain prestige when it doesnt taste all that good. Sometimes the look becomes more important than the taste. Food photography made an impact that way years ago. The visual is important but you want to eat something that has real taste. Knowing what to put together is very important. If you area great creator you are fantastic. If you are just trying to be in fashion chances are its not worth it. In Spain chefs have gone through innovation using science and technology and because of the reaction by Spaniards they have come back a bit. The roots are there they want to use regional ingredients. I love the cooking of Santi Santamaria (a prominent avant-garde Catalan and Spanish chef). Its exciting but its not what home cooking is about. Its good to shake the Spaniards out of bad habits for example frying everything. The French had the same experience with Nouvelle Cuisine but they have gone back to their original culture. Its important to find the balance between old and new. For restaurant chefs its one thing but for home cooks its another thing altogether. It seems people entertain more in England than they do in the US but sometimes what they do is too fussy (influenced by the culinary innovators). To entertain you should do one big dish and have everyone serve themselves. People are afraid to entertain because they think its old-fashioned. Thats a shame.

                    .Content="Interview with Claudia Roden - part 1 Photo credit Red Saunders Historian Simon Schama once stated Claudia Roden is no more a simple cookbook writer than Marcel Proust was a biscuit baker. She is rather memorialist historian ethnographer anthropologist essayist poet. It is for all these reasons that I am such an admirer of Claudia Roden. By her own admission she has sometimes led a very charmed life traveling eating and learning about food and culture. Presenting food in a cultural context is what sets her cookbooks apart and has won her such respect and acclaim. Roden resides in London but was recently in the US for the James Beard Awards where her landmark book The Book of Middle Eastern Food was inducted into the Cookbook Hall of Fame. Today read part 1 of my interview with her and tomorrow come back for part 2. Which cookbook of yours is your favorite and whyThe first one The Book of Middle Eastern Food is very important to me because it was a labor of love well all of them are labors of love but that one meant a lot to me because I was researching an area I thought I would never go back to ever again. It was a part of a world that was so important to my family. I researched a lot of it from talking to people a lot of the recipes had never been in print before. There were so many people from different cultures living in Egypt where I grew up my family was from Syria and Turkey married into families from Morocco. When I was researching baklava everyone said its ours so I realized it was important to research and really learn about these recipes many of which had never been written in a cookbook before. It was very important in that way but every book is important too. The Jewish book (The Book of Jewish Food) was emotional too food is always emotional for me always important. Even with the Italian book (The Good Food of Italy) I wanted to visit every region I was traveling for the Sunday Times (UK) and expanded my work for the book. It was a joy. I love the stories poems and jokes that you share in The Book of Middle Eastern Food whose idea was it to include those and how did you collect them It was my idea the reason was when I was researching the book when I was just collecting middle eastern recipes and I would tell people what I was doing and they were horrified Cooking was considered a low thing in England at the time and recipes even lower. The idea that it was the Middle East was very off-putting--they thought it would be all recipes for testicles and eyeballs. I needed to bring in the culture and what it meant to me so it would be important. Why would anyone eat brown beans unless they understand that theyve been eaten for a very long time that peasants who doesnt eat eat meat eat them etc. I wanted to endear the readers to the food through the culture. I went to the British Library and met with the Middle East curator and asked for resources. Everything was from the 13th century--Damascus Bagdhad culinary manuals they were in Arabic but they had been translated. I became fascinated with the recipes of the past that we were cooking with dishes that were cooking as well. I wasnt particularly interested in Jewish food at the time I thought we thought we were eating like everyone else and in a way we were. My fascination began with finding those books and finding studies and analysis based on society from food. Ive always marveled that as a Jewish woman you were able to gain access to so many Middle Eastern cultures. Were most of the recipes gathered in exileEveryone I talked to was in exile at the time and thats how I found people--Lebanese in Paris the Iraqis in London. I went to the Persian embassy not to ask for a visa but if I could meet the diplomats wives. Ive been in Lebanon for the last book I went to meet with people at Hezbollah. I was the most popular person everyone wanted to talk to me about food Everyone knew I was Jewish but they were fascinated. Jews were part of that world (the Middle East) for centuries. We improved their lives their economy and their culture. We share the same humor. I find that all the young journalists want Jewish recipes. In a way I find that there is nothing better than food to bond and open doors. I find the Christian communities can be difficult with the Jews because they have been in competition as minorities with us though not in Lebanon. There is the old blood libel. There was an animosity. But now they are the ones who are suffering. I go to the Middle East to give lectures. I go to Turkey a lot--I am friends with Sufis and they come with me to the synagogue. One day a religious woman who I am closest to asked me was it the Jews who bombed the twin towers All I could do was laugh. There is a lot of anti-Jewish propaganda but they dont deeply believe it. When they see you as a person they are fascinated. I went to a literary festival in Dubai there were Israelis attending and everyone wanted to talk to them. In Spain there was a Taste of Peace event with chefs from the Middle East.There is need to connect through food. I am never worried when I go to the Middle East. Food is a bond. I have been trying to do a chefs for peace event in the West Bank. The Israelis are keen to do it but the Palestinians say the time is not right.What do you think will get people back in the kitchen cooking again We have the same problem with people not cooking in England as you do in the US. It does seem because people have less money they are coming around to seeing that it is cheaper to cook at home than to eat out. There is a new trend of people growing there own vegetables. TV chefs have helped to popularize this. A lot of people are buying CSA boxes. I think this might get people started again. Jamie Oliver has a new series on 20 minute cooking. I admire him very much. He has done fantastic good. Cooking in 20 minutes might get people back in the kitchen. In my recipes I have some that take a long time but they are just on the stove for a long time unattended.  Habits have changed. I want to make things lighter and healthier. I want to write the way people cook now. Some dishes I tried that took a long time thats ok but it has to be really fantastic. One night 3 of my granddaughters stayed the night and I made a Catalan cannelloni with stuffing that had liver and brains and lots of steps. I told them my rules it must be really really delicious to be worth taking a long time and lots of work to prepare and they were very keen on cannelloni but they told me the dish is not worth the effort. With the pressure to cook in less time do you recommend using a pressure cooker In Morocco and Spain it is very commonly used but Im convinced dishes cooked in the pressure cooker dont have the same flavor. When using it you must finish dishes with the top off and let sauces reduce.  Cooking starts with oil which carries the scents and flavors. When I was in Morocco a young man complained to me that he used to walk the streets and could tell what everyone was cooking and now he cant smell anything. Pressure cookers encourage overcooking and pureeing.READ MORE Check out the concluding post part 2 of my interview with Claudia RodenDO NOT STEAL 2010 Cooking with Amy. All rights reserved.

                    .Content="Turkey and Zucchini Green Chili With the weather starting to get cooler I have been thinking about soups and stews a lot more.  Even with the cooler weather the markets still have a lot of late summers produce and I figured that it was the perfect time to enjoy some of those vegetables in a warm and hearty stew.  I remembered seeing some tomatillos the week before and I was immediately thinking about a salsa verde and a green chili.  A green chili or a chili verde is a chili that uses tomatillos and green chilis such as poblano and jalapeno chilies instead of tomatoes and red chilies.  I tend to associate turkey with fall and it had been a very long time since I had used any so it was the natural meat for the chili.  With the base of the chili done I packed in more vegetables in the form of some zucchini and corn and I bulked everything up with some white beans.  Despite the fact that the salsa verde was already bringing a lot of flavour to the table I could not resist adding even more with a heaping tablespoon of cumin along with some oregano.  This ended up being one really tasty chili that was also nice and tasty and it really hit the spot on a cool dayTurkey and Zucchini Green Chili(makes 4 servings)Printable RecipeIngredients1 tablespoon oil1 onion (diced)4 cloves garlic (chopped)1 tablespoon cumin (toasted and ground)1 pound ground turkey3 cups chicken stock2 cups salsa verde1 (19 ounce) can white beans (rinsed and drained)1 teaspoon oregano2 jalapeno peppers (or to taste diced)salt and pepper to taste1 pound zucchini (cut into bite sized pieces)1 cup corn1 handful cilantro (chopped)Directions1.

                    .Content="Roasted Red Peppers Roasted red peppers have to be one of my favorite foods and right now the farmers market is filled with perfectly field ripened red peppers that are just waiting to be roasted.  Roasting the red peppers makes them nice and tender and it intensifies their flavour and sweetness along with imparting them with a touch of smokiness.  Although you could easily buy jarred roasted red peppers they are so easy to make at home and always good  There are several ways of roasting tried peppers and I find the easiest way is to broil them in the oven one large baking sheet at a time.  You can easily use this method to roast other peppers like poblanos or even jalapeos. Roasted red peppers keep really well in the freezer so every year around this time I pick up a large basket full of those red peppers from the farmers market and I spend a weekend roasting them all up.  I like to freeze the roasted red peppers individually in zip-lock sandwich bags so that I can quickly grab them as needed throughout the rest of the year.  Although you can peel the skins off before freezing them I tend to leave them on as it would take a bit of time to peel them all up front whereas it only takes a moment to peel the one you are using when you thaw it.Some of the tricks to roasting red peppers is to let the skin fully char and blacken.  As it does it blisters up of of the flesh making it easier to peel.   Another trick  is placing the charred red peppers in a sealed container while they are still hot.  This created a kind of steaming effect while they cool that also makes them easier to peel. You can use any type of sealable container or even a plate on top of a bowl would work.  Just let them sit in the container until they are cool enough to handle and then the skin should easily pinch off.  When I am freezing the peppers the zip-lock bags that I will store them in are perfect but if I am making them to use right away I prefer to use a reusable container.How to Roast Red Peppers(makes 1 roasted red pepper)Printable RecipeIngredientsred peppersDirections1. Cut the red peppers in half remove the stem and seeds.2. Place the red peppers on a baking sheet with the cut side facing down.3. Preheat the oven to 450F and then change it to broil.4. Place the baking sheet on the top shelf in the oven and broil until the outer layer of the skin has blackened about 10-20 minutes.5. Place the peppers in a zip-lock bag or other sealable container seal and let them cool until you can handle them about 20 minutes.6. Remove the skins from the peppers.

                    .Content="Hot Cheesy Mushroom Dip Mushrooms have to be one of my all time favorite foods which is why when Mushrooms Canada approached me about taking part in an international mushroom tournament I jumped at the chance to take part  The name of the game is Mushroom Masters A Tournament of Taste and the basic idea behind it is that food bloggers in association with mushroom organizations from Canada the United States and Australia would develop and photograph new mushroom recipes to face  off against each other once a week for the month of September which is mushroom month.  The photographs have been appearing on Taste Spotting for the show down for the last few weeks this week it was my turn to represent team Canada with a tasty new mushroom dish.Luckily I drew the wild card and I was allowed to use pretty much any commonly available mushroom.  My biggest problem for this challenge however was that I had too many ideas When I sat down to brain storm I ended up with over a dozen ideas within a few minutes.  I was able to narrow the list down to six recipes which I ended up making all in one weekend and this hot cheesy mushroom dip was my favourite from among them.I had been craving a hot cheesy dip for a while and the idea one infused with mushroomy goodness was too hard to resist.  I started out by sauteing some mushrooms in butter along with some onions garlic and thyme and I finished things of with a splash of wine.  You could use pretty mush any mushroom you want in this dip and I went for my goto mushroom the cremini mushroom to keep things nice and simple.  I then pureed half of the mushrooms in a food processor to make sure that the mushroom flavour penetrated the entire dip and I left the other half of the mushrooms the way they were so that I could also enjoy their texture.  From there I incorporated the mushrooms into a pretty standard hot cheesy dip base and baked the whole thing in the oven until it was nice and bubbling and golden brown.I have to say that if you like mushrooms and you like hot cheesy dips then this is the dip for you  I was immediately hooked and the entire batch disappeared much quicker than it should have  I served the mushroom dip on toasty sliced baguette along with a glass of that white wine.Take a look at the Hot Cheesy Mushroom Dip Recipe on Mushrooms Canadas BlogTake a look at this weeks Mushroom Masters A Tournament of Taste contest on Taste Spotting and voteSimilar RecipesMushroom BouyiourdiHot Caramelized Onion DipHot Cheesy Bean DipJalapeno Popper DipDisclaimer I have received compensation from Mushrooms Canada for my recipe and photos." _

                    .Content="Fried Green Tomatoes with Shrimp Remoulade Last week a kind reader left a comment on my fried green tomatoes recipe suggesting that I try fried green tomato shrimp remoulade.  I am always looking for new ways to enjoy fried green tomatoes and there is no way that you could go wrong topping them off with some shrimp in a tasty remoulade sauce.  As luck would have it I remembered seeing some green tomatoes at the farmers market last week so the fried green tomato shrimp remoulade made it to my meal plan really quickly )  This recipe is pretty easy and you can even make the remoulade sauce the day before which works out for the best as the flavours get a chance to mingle overnight.  While researching this recipe I found out that this dish is often served with the shrimp and remoulade sauce chilled while the fried green tomatoes are piping hot to add a nice contrasting temperature to the dish.  I have to say that the tangy fried green tomatoes go really well with the sweet and juicy shrimp in their tasty remoulade sauce  This recipe would work equally well for a light meal of as an appetizer.Fried Green Tomatoes with Shrimp Remoulade(makes 2 servings)Printable RecipeIngredients2 cups salad greens (optional)6 slices fried green tomatoes (hot)12 large shrimp (shelled deviened cooked and chilled)1 batch remoulade sauce (chilled)Directions1.

                    .Content="Chimichurri Steak Sandwiches with Roasted Corn and Red Pepper Salsa The reason that I was making chimichurri sauce so late in the summer was that I had just one more dish with corn that I just had to get in before it disappeared from the farmers market.  A while ago I came across a photo which I cannot find now of a sandwich with sliced steak a green sauce and corn and I immediately thought that it was a grilled steak with chimichurri and corn salsa sandwich.  I can take any excuse to pick up a nice piece of steak and barley sear it to medium rare perfection and the thought of combining that tender steak with a flavourful chimichurri sauce and a sweet corn and red pepper salsa all wrapped up into a sandwich was impossible to resist.  Luckily I was still able to get some corn at the farmers market the week after I got back from my vacation and I got a chance to make these delightful sandwiches.  Although you have to cook a steak make the chimichurri make the salsa and then assemble everything into a sandwich it is definitely worth the effort as these sandwiches are packed with flavour  I tried some of the leftovers with some crumbled feta and the saltiness complimented the sweetness of the salsa particularly well.Chimichurri Steak Sandwiches with Roasted Corn and Red Pepper Salsa(makes 4 servings)Printable RecipeIngredients1 pound steak (cut of choice I used a rib eye)1 tablespoon chili powdersalt and pepper to taste1 tablespoon oil4 buns1 batch chimichurri sauce1 batch roasted corn and red pepper salsa (see below)14 cup feta (crumbled optional)Directions1.

In addition to the parsley it commonly contains garlic vinegar and red pepper flakes.  Of course there are many variations on the sauce and it commonly includes other ingredients.  I play around with this chimichurri recipe a lot but this is my favorite version so far. Chimichurri is nice and light and fresh and just packed with flavour and it goes really well on grilled meats especially steak.

The other week I made some Thai style corn fritters that I really enjoyed and while I was eating them I figured that a Mexican flavoured version would also be amazing.  The idea for the recipe was pretty simple with the main flavours coming from some smoky chipotle chili powder along with some freshly toasted and ground cumin.  From there I needed to add something green and green onions and cilantro were the perfect fit.  Mexican dishes very often contain cheese and at first I was thinking that I would just sprinkle some cheese on top when I served the fritters but then I thought Why not add the cheese directly to the fritters and let it melt and get all gooey and good while the fritters cook  I then finished the fritters off with hit of lime juice to brighten things up.  The Mexican inspired corn fritters were just as good as I imagined and I really like the way that the cheddar cheese melted and fried as the fritters cooked just like that cheese that spills out the side of a grilled cheese sandwich and browns and gets all mmm mmm good  I served the corn fritters with some salsa and a dab of sour cream.Texmex Style Corn Fritters(makes 2 servings)Printable RecipeIngredients2 cups corn14 cup cornmeal14 cup flour1 egg12 cup cheddar cheese (grated)12 tablespoon chipotle chili powder12 teaspoon cumin (toasted and ground)1 green onion (chopped)1 handful cilantro (chopped)1 tablespoon lime juice2 tablespoons oil14 cup salsaDirections1.

Late summer is the best time to enjoy the perfectly ripe field tomatoes as they are nice and juicy and full of flavour.  The hot house tomatoes that you can get year round are nice enough but they simply do not compare to the field tomatoes at this time of year and I have been taking advantage of them.  As tasty as the field ripened tomatoes are I often like to roast them to concentrate their flavour even more.

There were just so many things that I wanted to try that I did not end up ordering the sweet corn soup but I figured that I could make it at home.  With the end of corn season within sight it was time to try making a sweet corn soup and this weekend I got the chance to.  I went with a very simple version of the soup with garlic ginger green onions and soy sauce for flavour in addition to the corn and chicken and I could not resist adding a bit of heat in the form of a birds eye chili.  One thing that I really like about many Chinese soups is the egg drop which adds a really amazing texture to the soup and makes it a bit more filling.  I also added a touch of corn flour to thicken the soup up a bit.  (If you prefer an even thicker soup feel free to add more corn flour.)  One thing that I find is quintessential about Asian cuisine is that aroma of toasted sesame oil so I added a few drops to the soup to finish it off.

A pistou is similar to a pesto and since pestos can be made from many different ingredients why not a zucchini pistou  I particularly like the way that this recipe includes zucchini in two different forms both pureed in the pistou and sliced in the pasta for lots of zucchini goodness.

I was absolutely thrilled to have the chance to meet some food bloggers in person that I had previously only known online.  I also had the opportunity to meet many new friends and the conversations were never dull.  The weekend was filled with seminars some of which I felt did not really apply to me but I learned a bit and I look forward to trying to improve Closet Cooking with what I have learned.  In between all of the seminars was of course a ton of food and drink.  Out of all of the great food I have to say that the food truck lunch was my favorite.  There are no food trucks here in Toronto and I had really been looking forward to trying out some taco truck tacos and Seattles taco trucks did not disappointed  You can see some of my photos from the IFBC hereInternational Food Bloggers Conference (IFBC) GalleryAfter the IFBC was over I stayed in Seattle for a few days to explore everything foodie in Seattle and thanks to your amazing suggestions I had a very delicious time  I got to try some classics like dungeness crab cakes Pike Place chowder Beechers mac and cheese the Crumpet Shop and the Salumi mozzarella mole sandwich.  For those that are interested you can see more of my adventures in Seattle hereSeattle 2010 GalleryNext up was a trip back to Canada to visit Vancouver BC and was it ever an adventure   Day one included a visit to Canada Place followed by the Lonsdale Market where I got to try a Canadian treat the beaver tail and I finished the day off with a stop in Chinatown.  Up next was a quick walk through Stanley park followed by an afternoon in the Granville Market.  Although my trip was full of great food I have to say that the meal that night at Vijs was by far the best even though there was a two hour wait to get a seat  The next day it was back to Chinatown to walk through the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden followed by a quick walk through Yale Town and Gas Town and then it was off to the Richmond night market.  The night market was amazing and just packed with tasty food.  I got the chance to try both takoyaki and taiyaki which I have been wanting to try for a while.  On my final day in BC it was up to Whistler to experience some of BCs natural beauty and to scale to the top of the mountain.For those that are interested you can see more of my adventures in Vancouver hereVancouver 2010 GalleryTime to get cooking" _

Basil pesto is as easy to make and pureeing everything in a food processor and it captures the essence of summer perfectly.  The easiest way to enjoy basil pesto is on pasta but you can also use it as a condiment and it adds a ton of summery fresh flavour to whatever you add it to and I particularly like adding it to sandwiches.  Another great thing about basil pesto is that it freezes well so you can save some of summers essence for later.  If you plan on freezing it omit the parmigiano-reggiano and add it when you thaw it out.Basil Pesto(makes 1 cup)Printable RecipeIngredients1 cup basil (packed)1 clove garlic2 tablespoons pine nuts (toasted)14 cup parmigiano-reggiano (grated)3 tablespoons olive oillemon juice to tastesalt and pepper to tasteDirections1.

This weekend I got a few too many of them to finish in the week simply by snacking on them and it was about time that I got down to making something with them.  Crisps crumbles and cobblers are by far one of the easiest ways too use a lot of fruit and this crumble has been on my mind for a while.  The main idea of this crumble was to use amaretti cookie crumbs to make the topping and to hit the peach filling with a splash of amaretto.  To continue building on the almond flavours I added some slivered almonds to the topping as well.  This crumble was as easy as cutting up some peaches mixing the topping and baking it and the rewards of so little effort are amazing  The amaretti crumble topping was phenomenal and it went really well with the peaches.  Of course I absolutely had to serve the peach crumble with a scoop of melting vanilla ice cream.Peach Amaretti Crumble(makes 4 servings)Printable RecipeIngredients2 pounds ripe peaches (pealed stoned and sliced)14 cup amaretto1 tablespoon cornstarch23 cup flour23 cup amaretti cookies (crushed)14 cup almonds (sliced)23 cup brown sugar13 cup butter (melted)Directions1.

A burrito bowl is just what it sounds like all of the contents of a burrito piled on top of each other in a bowl rather than wrapped up in a tortilla.  Every once in a while I like to go with the burrito bowl rather than a burrito and when you make them by yourself you can control both the portion size and exactly what goes in it so you can keep it nice and light and healthy without compromising on flavour.  For this burrito bowl I started with a base of cilantro lime rice made with a brown rice some creamy and spicy seasoned black beans a fresh pico de gallo and of course the tequila lime grilled chicken.  I finished the burrito bowls off with a dollop of light sour cream and a touch of grated jack and cheddar cheese for that extra hit of flavour.Burrito Bowls(makes 2 servings)Printable RecipeIngredients1 cup cilantro lime rice (warm I used brown rice)12 cup seasoned black beans12 cup pico de gallo1 tequila lime grilled chicken breast (sliced and divided)14 cup  jack and cheddar cheese (shredded)2 tablespoons sour cream (optional)1 handful cilantro (chopped)Directions1.

One of the things that I really like about this recipe is that other than the tequila and the lime you can play around with the ingredients to change up the flavour profile.  I often like to use chipotle chilies in adobo sauce for the source of heat or even a freshly ground chili pepper blend but in the summer with all of the fresh ingredients around it is hard to resist making it an all green sauce with jalapeos and a hit of cilantro.  If you are in a hurry you can marinate the chicken for as little as a half an hour but over night is best.

With the fresh ripe tomatoes in hand the first thing on my mind was a caprese salad  A caprese salad or insalata caprese is a salad consisting of tomatoes buffalo mozzarella and basil.  Because this salad is so simple you want to use the best ingredients possible including perfectly ripened field tomatoes.  Every year I look forward to tomato season when I can enjoy fresh caprese salads and I never tire of coming up with new ways to enjoy them.  This time I diced both the tomatoes and the mozzarella and used my mini spring form pan to construct a layered stack.  For the basil component of the salad I topped the tower with a dollop of freshly made basil pesto and garnished the plate with drops of basil olive oil.

I was just about to add it to my grocery list when I though I wonder if I could make this at home  A quick search of the web turned up this recipe for a sweet chilli sauce that I found on She Simmers.  I certainly am glad that I took the time to look up the recipe and make it myself  Not only was it super easy to make but it was much better than any store bought variety that I have ever tried.  The recipe is pretty simple with what you would expect to find in it including some chilies garlic sugar vinegar and a bit of corn starch to thicken it up.  I could not find either the red jalapeos or the red serrano chilies so I went with some long pointed hot red chilies that I could find and a few birds eye chilies to ensure that the heat level was up there.  I also left the seed in for the extra heat and visual appearance.

With the amazing aroma of roasting corn and melted butter everywhere I could not resist coming come with an arm load of corn.  One of my favorites ways to enjoy corn is to just have it on the cob with melted butter and a touch of salt but it was clear that I was not going to be able to make it through all of the corn in time so I needed to use it in a recipe to help finish it up.  Luckily I had a list of things that I wanted to do with corn and I had just been waiting for it to arrive.  On top of that list was some Thai inspired corn fritters flavoured with homemade curry paste along with some green onions cilantro lime juice and fish sauce.  I immediately though of serving the fritters covered in a spicy peanut sauce but with the heat I wanted something a little lighter and a Thai sweet chili sauce sounded like it would be perfect.  one of the things that I like most about these corn fritters in addition to having an amazing flavour is how some of the kernels on the outside start to get a little crispy taking on the texture of those partially popped kernels of corn in popcorn which is really nice.

That all changed when I picked up a slow cooker as not only does it not radiate a lot of heat but it also produces perfectly tender pork every time.  I had been craving some of that sweet spicy moist and tender bbq pulled pork for a few days so I dusted off my slow cooker and started to cook up some pork.  This recipe is dead easy where you  simply cook the pork in the slow cooker pull it and mix some bbq sauce into it.  You could make it even easier by using your favorite store bought brand of bbq sauce but making your own is pretty easy and you get to make it just how you want it.  This time I threw some chipotle chilies in adobo sauce into the bbq sauce both as the primary source of heat to add some smokiness.  It just wouldnt be a bbq pulled pork sandwich without a generous helping of coleslaw thrown in and once again I went with the make your own option.

                    .Content="Blueberry Maple Pecan Cinnamon Buns The farmers market was absolutely overflowing with cheap local blueberries this weekend and I picked up a lot of them.  Although I will finish a lot of them off for breakfast on plain yogurt with a touch of maple syrup I wanted to do something with them and I knew exactly what.  I had been wanting to try doing a cinnamon bun stuffed with fruit or berries and I had originally planned on trying it with strawberries but they disappeared just before I got the chance and a blueberry version now sounded even better.  The idea was basically to make cinnamon buns and where you add blueberries to the cinnamon layer before rolling them up.  I figured that wild blueberries would be perfect for these cinnamon buns as they were smaller and rolling them up would be easier.  I could have just gone with that but I kept thinking about how much I like the blueberry and maple flavour combination and so I decided to replace the sugar in the cinnamon layer with maple sugar and I then mixed some maple syrup into the cream cheese glaze.  While I was adding things I could not resist also adding some chopped pecans which also pair well with blueberries.The blueberry maple pecan cinnamon buns turned out so amazingly well  I really liked how the blueberries in the cinnamon layer baked up in the buns with many of them bursting and spreading their blueberry goodness even further.  The blueberry maple pecan flavour combination was definitely a winner and it went perfectly in the light and fluffy buns.  You can bake the cinnamon buns in several different ways to get different results.  You can either leave them with lots of room to spread out when they bake or you can pack they in tightly next to each other to get thicker buns.  I baked most of mine in a spring form pan and I put the extras in ramekins and the ones that were baked in the ramekins were my favourites by far.Blueberry Maple Pecan Cinnamon Buns(makes 12 buns)Printable RecipeIngredients1 recipe basic sweet yeast dough (see below)12 cups maple sugar (or white or brown)2 teaspoons cinnamon1 cup wild blueberries12 cup pecans (toasted and chopped)1 batch maple cream cheese glaze (see below)Directions1.

Arrange the buns in a greased pan cover in plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size about 1 hour and 30 minutes.7. Bake in a 375F preheated oven until golden brown about 15-20 minutes.8.

Not too long ago I ended up with some leftover spinach pesto and I had been experimenting with grilled cheese sandwiches at the time and naturally the spinach pesto grilled cheese sandwich was born.  I really liked the way the pesto worked in a grilled cheese sandwich and I had just been itching to try it again so I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the tasty left over sun dried tomato pesto.Although the basic grilled cheese sandwich is pretty simple there are endless ways to make them more exciting from simply changing up the cheese to adding extra flavours.  With the primary ingredient of this sandwich being the sun dried tomato pesto I was thinking tomatoes and for a cheese the natural choice seemed to be mozzarella.  With the tomatoes and mozzarella on my mind I started thinking about caprese salads and as luck would have it I also had some fresh basil left over from the tart and with that my sandwich was finished.  Once again I was throughly impressed by how amazingly well the pesto worked in a grilled cheese sandwich  The sun dried tomato pesto just packed the sandwich full of flavour and the basil brought a hint of freshness.  The melted cheese brought everything together and the toasted buttery golden brown bread finished things off perfectly.Sundried Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese Sandwich(makes 1 sandwich)Printable RecipeIngredients3 tablespoons sundried tomato pesto1 slice mozzarella cheese1 handful basil leaves2 slices bread1 tablespoon butterDirections1.

These simple premade pastry tarts are so easy to make and they always taste great  You pretty much just roll out some puff pastry or oil up a few sheets of phyllo dough and then top it off rather like a pizza with sauces cheeses and vegetables.  Despite the fact that the topping options are near endless I have been enjoying highlighting a single in season vegetable like asparagus tomatoes or zucchini.  One of my favorites so far has been a zucchini and feta ricotta tart so when I came across a zucchini and sun dried tomato pesto parmesan tart on Cook Sister it made it to my meal plan as soon as the local zucchini was inIn my opinion you really cant go wrong with a flavour packed sun dried tomato pesto so I already knew that this tart was going to be a winner.  Knowing that the sun dried tomato pesto was going to be key to this dish I set about making my own and homemade pesto is actually rather easy.  Although you could mash everything up in a mortar and pestle as is traditional it is much easier to just throw the ingredients into a food processor and puree them.  One of the things that I like so much about making you own pesto is that you can experiment and change up the flavours each time by using different nuts cheeses or even adding new things like say a splash of balsamic vinegar.  With tomato season just around the corner you could even make you own oven dried tomatoes for use in this pesto.Zucchini and Sun Dried Tomato Pesto Parmesan Tart(makes 4 servings)Printable RecipeIngredients1 sheet puff pastry (thawed according to the packages directions)12 cup sundried tomato pesto12 cup parmigiano regginao (grated)1 handful basil (torn)1 large zucchini (thinly sliced)salt and pepper to taste1 tablespoon olive oilDirections1.
